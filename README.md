# jpack

This Java package aims at making it easy to quickly write readable and efficient
code for general scientific computing. It is a toolbox that tries to be coherent,
concise, and easy to integrate.

So far, **jpack** provides

* Linear algebra primitives
* An implementation of [CMA-ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES), a 
black-box, derivative-free optimization algorithm . It's a state-of-the-art, 
a strong benchmark champion, it's used in the industry, and it has strong 
theoritical foundations. A few variations are provided, so that one can exploits
hypothesis on the optimization problem.
* A very bare-bone implementation of feed-forward neural network.

I (the original author) plan to add tools in **jpack** as time goes.
